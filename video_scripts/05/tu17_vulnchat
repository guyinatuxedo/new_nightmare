# Intro
	-	What is this challenge
	-	File/pwn checksec/run

# Main Reversing
	-	See it prints out the text
	-	See it scans in with two scanfs
	-	See the fmt string
	-	Looking at stack layout, see the overflows
	-	What is a return address?
	-	Explain two overflows, one to fmtstring, other to return address

# What function to call
	-	Find printFlag
	-	Explain what it is, and why it will solve the challenge
	-	Explain the address we will call to get this

# Gdb Shenanigans
	-	In gdb, find offsets to fmtstring, then return address
	-	Show base overflow in action

# Stack Frame
	-	Explain how we can figure out the offsets from the ghidra stack offset

# Exploit
	-	Review exploit
	-	In gdb, show exploit first overflow
	-	In gdb, show exploit second overflow
	-	In gdb, show return
	-	outside of gdb, show exploit working
