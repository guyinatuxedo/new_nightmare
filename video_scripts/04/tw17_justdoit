Intro
	-	What chall is this
	-	file/pwn checksec/run

Flag File
	-	Show flag file being opened
	-	Explain error, show binary running with flag file
	-	Explain flag file being scanned into bss flag
	-	Explain what bss is, static address `0x0804a080`

Input
	-	Explain our input being scanned into `input` `0x20` bytes
	-	Explain that it is an overflow

Comparison
	-	Explain what our input is being compared against
	-	Explain affect if we do, or don't pass the comparison
	-	Explain printing thing
	-	Explain that comparison doesn't matter, but the puts thing on stack ptr does

Overflow
	-	Explain that since we can overwrite a stack ptr that is printed, and we know the address of where the flag is in memory, we can simply overwrite the stack ptrwith address of flag
	-	Figure out offset
	-	In gdb, show flag being scanend in
	-	In gdb, show printedPtr being overwritten

Exploit
	-	Review exploit
	-	In gdb, show exploit overwriting `printedPtr` with flag thingie
	-	Show exploit getting the flag successfully.
